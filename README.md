# Weekday Tracker

A simple and lightweight weekday tracker designed for speedrunners.

Originally created to assist with tracking in-game days in **Harvest Moon (SNES)**, but can be used with any game or activity that follows a 7-day cycle.

### Features
- Click the **"Next Day"** button or use a custom hotkey to manually advance to the next weekday.
- The weekday order is: **Monday → Tuesday → Wednesday → Thursday → Friday → Saturday → Sunday → Monday** (and so on).
- **Dark Mode** toggle available via a small button at the bottom of the app.
- Set your own hotkey using a pop-up — just press your key and it’s set instantly.
- The current hotkey is displayed in the main window.
- **Global Hotkey** option to toggle on/off, also accessible from the app.
- Standalone **EXE**, no installation required.
- Python file, also available.

### How to Use
1. Launch the app (`weekday_tracker.exe`).
2. Click **"Next Day"** or press your assigned hotkey to move forward in the week.
3. Click **"Set Hotkey"** to assign a new one — a pop-up will open, press your desired key.
4. Click the small **"Dark Mode"** button to toggle the theme.
5. If needed, toggle the **Global Hotkey** using the button in the settings.

### Notes
- Designed for use while playing games — perfect for speedrunners who need to track in-game weekdays.
- The app starts with **Monday** by default and wraps back to Monday after Sunday.
- The hotkey and day state are **not saved** between sessions (resets on close).
- No installation required, just download and run the executable.
- "N" does always work for Next Day

### Requirements
- **Python** (if using the source code).

### License
Free to use, open-source.
