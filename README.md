# Weekday Tracker

A simple and lightweight weekday tracker designed for speedrunners.

Originally created to assist with tracking in-game days in *Harvest Moon* (SNES), but can be used with any game or activity that follows a 7-day cycle.

## Features

- Click the **"Next Day"** button or use a **custom hotkey** to manually advance to the next weekday.
- The weekday order is: **Monday → Tuesday → Wednesday → Thursday → Friday → Saturday → Sunday → Monday** (and so on).
- **Dark Mode toggle** available via a small button at the bottom of the app.
- **Set your own hotkey** using a pop-up — just press your key and it’s set instantly.
- The current hotkey is displayed in the main window.
- **Standalone EXE**, no installation required.
- **Python file**, also available

## How to Use

1. Launch the app (`weekday_tracker.exe`).
2. Click **"Next Day"** or press your assigned hotkey to move forward in the week.
3. Click **"Change Hotkey"** to assign a new one — a pop-up will open, press your desired key.
4. Click the small **"Dark Mode"** button to toggle the theme.

## Notes

- Designed for use while playing games — perfect for speedrunners who need to track in-game weekdays.
- The app starts with **Monday** by default and wraps back to Monday after Sunday.
- The hotkey and day state are **not saved** between sessions (resets on close).
